    <h3 id="whowhen$$">Who, When developed jQuery</h3>

    <p>John Resig developed jQuery. He started working in the library in 2005. jQuery was first created in January 2006 at
        BarCamp NYC through John Resig, prompted using Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library. It's currently maintained via
        a crew of developers led by Timmy Willison (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being shown through Richard Gibson).
    </p>

    <p>jQuery turned into originally certified beneath the CC by using SA 2. Five and relicensed to the MIT license in 2006.
        At the end of 2006, it became dual licensed underneath GPL and MIT licenses. As this brought about some confusion,
        in 2012, the GPL was dropped and is now the handiest license under the MIT license.
    </p>

    <h3 id="whyneed$$">Why jQuery was Needed</h3>

    <p>John Resig created jQuery with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the process of writing JavaScript code, for web
        developers. This library was designed to offer a speedy and user-friendly interface for managing DOM, events, AJAX requests
        and animations. Its introduction brought about a transformation in web development by providing a yet straightforward API.
        As a result, jQuery quickly became one of the used and popular JavaScript <br>libraries. Its influence has also played a role,
        in the development of JavaScript libraries and frameworks contributing to the growth of dynamic web applications.
    </p>

    <h3 id="devs$$">Current Developers</h3>

    <p>jQuery is primarily upheld by a team of volunteers and contributors, from the open-source community. The "jQuery Core Team,"
        which is the group oversees project management reviews code contributions addresses bugs and rolls out releases.
    </p>

    <p>Dave Methvin is the organization's President, while Kris Borchers is the Executive Director. Together, they lead and oversee
        the jQuery operations, ensuring its success and growth.
    </p>

    <h3 id="growth$$"> Growth and Decline of jQuery </h3>

    <p>
        One of the oldest and most well-known JavaScript libraries on the internet is jQuery.
        According to BuiltWith, jQuery is used in some form by an amazing 78% of the top 1 million websites.
        React, the JavaScript library that is now receiving the most attention, is only used by 14% of developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in 2006, when the word "Ajax" was at the height of its popularity, jQuery was introduced. Along with
        other JavaScript technologies from the early Web 2.0 period, Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) has long since
        disappeared from the developer lexicon. But jQuery has endured over years. Indeed, it continued to rise year on year until very recently.
    </p>

    <p>
        In recent years, jQuery's popularity has started to decrease. Bootstrap v5 will eliminate jQuery because it is the framework's
        "largest client-side dependency for regular JavaScript". GitHub also removed jQuery from the front end of their website.
        jQuery's status as a necessary tool has been decreased by the rise of frontend JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Vue, React
        and the fetch API. jQuery's excessive implementation has forced it to slow down in the face of the newer wave of web technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this modern age, due to the decline of the usage of jQuery JavaScript library you can find numerous alternatives that can be implemented instead of using jQuery.
        Such alternatives can be referred to by clicking <a href="https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/" id="Click-here-link">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although jQuery is getting a little outdated in light of recent developments in the frontend space, use cases still exist based on the requirements of your project. <br>
        Currently, jQuery is used by both WordPress and Bootstrap to create their components and themes. Even though they might not begin brand-new projects with jQuery, many
        of the major software companies continue to expand on those that did. <br><br>
        Although due to its constant decline in recent years, the jQuery library continues to be one of the most widely used libraries in older programming.
        Its guiding principle of writing less to do more makes it a still widely used library today.
        <br><br>
        "Write less, do more."
        <br><br>
        The most well-known and extensible JavaScript library to this day is definitely jQuery. Large corporations like Netflix, Google, IBM,
        and Microsoft use it.
    </p>

    <p>It is often the first library that writers of JavaScript learn because:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Compared to the native XmlHttpRequest, its AJAX call syntax is quite straightforward.</li>
        <li>It provides quick fixes for typical JavaScript issues like sorting and filtering arrays.</li>
        <li>jQuery is dependent on a lot of other libraries.</li>
        <li>It operates on Node's server side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="future$$"> Future of jQuery </h3>

    <p>
        Although it is difficult for jQuery to regain its prior supremacy in the face of the development
        of new JavaScript frameworks and libraries, developers will continue to use jQuery. Many experts advise
        against using jQuery instead of Angular, although that decision really depends on the application you're working on.
        80% of websites, and 96% of those that employ jQuery, use some form of JavaScript in their code, according to some reports.
        It is advised to study the basic principles of jQuery, but not to go in-depth, since it makes it easier to work on existing
        projects in the future as jQuery is still used in the majority of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bootstrap, which is used to create templates for many websites, has been bundled with jQuery, proving that it won't die anytime soon.
        Some well-known SaaS, such as WordPress, continue to use jQuery for their backend and to integrate plugins into their website.
        Even though it can appear outdated, mastering jQuery is always helpful when working on new projects and wouldnâ€™t look bad on your CV too.
    </p>

    <h3 id="related$$"> Related technologies </h3>

    <p>
        All along we have been discussing technologies which are related to jQuery and act as alternatives to jQuery.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below are a few of the related and alternative technologies of jQuery that we have discussed about:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Vanilla JavaScript (Plain JavaScript):   </dt>
        <dd>Using native JavaScript without any libraries can be a good alternative for simple projects or when specific jQuery functionalities are not needed. </dd>


        <dt>Axios:  </dt>
        <dd>A popular HTTP client library for making AJAX requests, similar to jQuery's AJAX methods.  </dd>


        <dt>Fetch API:   </dt>
        <dd>A native browser API for making AJAX requests, providing a modern alternative to jQuery's AJAX capabilities.  </dd>


        <dt>React:   </dt>
        <dd>A powerful and popular front-end library for building user interfaces, often used with other libraries like Axios for AJAX requests.  </dd>


        <dt>Vue.js:   </dt>
        <dd>Another modern front-end framework like React, offering reactive and component-based development.  </dd>


        <dt>AngularJS (Angular):   </dt>
        <dd>A robust front-end framework from Google that allows for building dynamic web applications.  </dd>


    </dl>

    <h3 id="compare$$"> Compare and contrast with other technologies </h3>

    <p>
        We have seen how some of these technologies act as alternatives to jQuery and how they have the potential to take over jQuery in
        recent times. Now we will compare how each of these new technologies fare against jQuery:
    </p>

    <h5> Vanilla JavaScript (Plain JavaScript): </h5>

    <p>
        Vanilla JavaScript, commonly referred to as Plain JavaScript, is the original and basic version of the JavaScript
        programming language, free of any third-party frameworks or libraries. It offers total control and flexibility over
        code and serves as the foundation of web development. Despite being lighter and quicker than jQuery due to the lack
        of additional overhead, it requires more code to complete several tasks that jQuery makes simpler with its utility methods.
        Vanilla JavaScript allows developers to take full advantage of all of JavaScript's features and capabilities, making it perfect
        for straightforward projects or situations where specific jQuery functionalities are not required.
    </p>

    <h5>Axios:  </h5>

    <p>
        An advanced JavaScript library called Axios was created primarily for AJAX-enabled HTTP queries. Compared to jQuery's AJAX
        capabilities, it offers a more modern and simplified syntax, making it simpler to perform asynchronous processes and manage
        API requests. Axios is excellent at properly managing failures and responses, giving developers more control over HTTP requests.
        Consequently, it has gained popularity for AJAX-related activities, especially in contemporary web development where its streamlined
        method fits in well with modern browser features.
    </p>

    <h5>Fetch API:  </h5>

    <p>
        The Fetch API is a native browser API that was developed as a modern replacement for jQuery's AJAX features. It provides a
        straightforward and consistent method for sending AJAX requests, eliminating the need for jQuery in modern browsers. The
        Fetch API employs Promises to handle asynchronous activities effectively, giving data retrieval and updating a more
        sophisticated and elegant approach. Because of its simplicity and Promises integration, it is a popular choice among
        developers who prefer native browser solutions for handling complex asynchronous flows.
    </p>

    <h5>React:  </h5>

    <p>
        Facebook created React, a sophisticated front-end toolkit for creating dynamic user interfaces (UIs). React, in comparison to
        jQuery, makes use of a component-based architecture that encourages reuse and modularity. As a result of creating a virtual
        DOM, rendering speed is increased by reducing the number of times the real DOM needs to be updated. Because React encourages
        declarative programming, developers may concentrate on "what" to display rather than "how" to do it. It has grown in popularity
        due to its effectiveness and adaptability for single-page applications (SPAs) and complicated applications.
    </p>

    <h5>Vue.js:  </h5>

    <p>
        Another modern front-end framework that resembles React is Vue.js. It features component-based development and
        responsiveness, making it simple to integrate into current projects and enabling progressive adoption. Developers
        can utilise as much or as little of the progressive framework vue.js as they choose, depending on the needs of
        the project. For developers looking for a more modern, lightweight, and versatile front-end solution, Vue.js is
        a tempting alternative to jQuery since it reduces repetitive code and provides features like two-way data binding.
    </p>

    <h5>AngularJS (Angular):  </h5>

    <p>
        Google created AngularJS, sometimes referred to as Angular, which is a powerful front-end framework. A feature
        not directly included in jQuery, it offers two-way data binding, enabling real-time updates between the model
        and view. AngularJS encourages organized and maintainable codebases by supporting dependency injection and
        modular development. However, compared to jQuery, it is more complex and comprehensive, making it better
        suited for bigger apps and enterprise-level projects. While AngularJS and jQuery do share some features,
        AngularJS is a full-featured framework with a steeper learning curve that offers a robust and complete set
        of tools for front-end development.
